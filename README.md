**COURSE DESCRIPTION:**
This doctorate-level course integrates cybersecurity concepts, principles, tools, and techniques into the system life-cycle including acquisition and purchasing of technology, security requirements definition during requirements analysis, secure software coding practices, auditing processes for production systems, cyber-insurance considerations, and communication security issues with upper management and the board.

**COURSE OBJECTIVES:**
Upon successful completion of this course students will be expected to:

- Critique ways in which cybersecurity is integrated with traditional business functions in support of system lifecycles.
- Strategize on appropriate approaches on how and when to present cybersecurity issues and potential solutions to higher management and board members.

- Develop effective non-functional security requirements for both hardware, software, and communications services.
- Evaluate the software development process, in-house or outsourced, and recommend standards for secure coding processes.
- Recommend auditing processes, policies, and standards for auditing computer systems in production, including those storing personally identifiable information (PII); and
- Explain risk and its mitigation through cyber-insurance.
